# Articles Example
## Getting started
 - create an empty MySQL database with the name `discussment`

 - run command `mvn tomcat7:run` in the __article__ folder where __pom.xml__ is located
   !must be compiled under java8, in 9 you will get errors!

 - this command runs compile source codes and creates a __war__ file that deploy in Tomcat. The example runs on web address: `localhost:8080/discussment-article/`

 - if you have done everything right, you'll see an empty dashboard, so it's time to register first user
