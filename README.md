# discussment
Library providing discussion/comment functionality to your application with simple interface.

## Readme: discussment-core 

The library creates basic services for the discussion.

### dependencies and environment 
Access to the database is solved via JPA. JPA currently uses the MySQL database, which is set in __persistence.xml__. For this reason, it is necessary to have a MySQL database installed.

Used dependencies:

- Hibernate 5.2.6.Final

- MySQL Connector 6.0.5

### build steps 
- In __persistence.xml__, you must set the database _url_, _user_, and his _password_.

- In the __discussion-core__ folder where the __pom.xml__ file is located, run command `mvn install`.

- The resulting __jar__ file is stored in a local maven repository.

### how-to use core
The __service__ package have interfaces that provides core services. The default implementation of services is in the __service.imp__ package.

The __service__ package contains these interfaces:
- __CategoryService__ contains methods for working with categories in a forum.

- __DiscussionService__ contains methods for working with discussions such as creating a separate discussion or a discussion in a topic.

- __PostService__ contains methods for working with posts in the discussion.

- __TopicService__ contains methods for working with topics in the forum.

- __UserService__ contains methods for working with users who are in the discussion.

The services need an interface to access the database, which is located in the dao package. The default implementation of services is in the __dao.imp__ package. If you need your own access, you need to implement this interface.

#### using JPA 2.0

The default implementation of DAOs uses JPA 2.1 and its `EntityManager`. To use it with JPA 2.0, active transaction check using EntityManager's `isJoinedToTransaction` method needs to be bypassed. For that purpose, there are two classes implementing `ITransactionHelper` interface.

All the DAOs have `GenericDaoJPA` class as their common parent. The `EntityManager` is injected to `GenericDaoJPA` using its constructor. In the constructor, a new instance of a transaction helper is created as well using the `EntityManager` - `JPA21TransactionHelper` is used by default. However, the helper in use can be reset later using a setter.

Below, a sample configuration of a Spring application using JPA 2.0 is outlined:

```xml
<bean id="discussmentTransactionHelper" class="org.danekja.discussment.core.dao.jpa.JPA20TransactionHelper"/>
<bean id="discussmentGenericDao" class="org.danekja.discussment.core.dao.jpa.GenericDaoJPA">
  <constructor-arg name="em" ref="entityManager"/>
  <property name="transactionHelper" ref="discussmentTransactionHelper"/>
</bean>
```

#### access control
The __accesscontrol__ package contains the new implementation of user's permissions. The default implementation of services is in the __service.impl__ package.

The authentication mechanism works in similar fashion as general Spring Security user authentication with **UserDetails** and **UserDetailsService** interfaces. The library receives user information from the application via defined interfaces (see below) and 
assignes own permission model for them.

Library methods for permission management contain granular configuration of access to each action (add, remove, view) and item (category, topic, discussion, post). Can be used as-is or the application which uses this library may implement own management on top of the provided 
functions e.g. to make permissions compliant with the application's roles.

The __domain__ package contains this interface:
- __IDiscussionUser__ represents the user entity in the context of this library. Any application using this library will have to implement this! Usually the interface should be implemented by the application's User entity and its methods delegated to User's properties.

The __service__ package contains these interfaces:
- __DiscussionUserService__ contains basic methods to obtain user object from application. Any application using this library will have to implement this! The library presumes the application has own authentication mechanism. This interface should take advantage of that mechanism and provide currently logged-in user.

- __PermissionManagementService__ contains methods for adding or changing user's permissions.
  - for example using this method will give user permissions for discussion in given __topic__. __PermissionData__ have values sorted _create_, _delete_, _edit_, _view_.
    ```
    configureDiscussionPermissions(IDiscussionUser user, Topic topic, PermissionData permissions);
    ```
  - example usage in application.
    ```
    permissionService.configureDiscussionPermissions(user, topicService.getTopicById(3), new PermissionData(true, false, false, true);
    ```
    - will give user permissions to _create_ and _view_ __discussions__ in __topic__ of id __3__.

- __AccessControlService__ contains methods for checking currently logged user's permissions. Has two main usages.
  - guards the __core services__ so user without sufficient permissions can't use requested method. The method then throws __AccessDeniedException__. 
    ```
     @Override
        public Topic getTopicById(long topicId) throws AccessDeniedException {
            Topic t = topicDao.getById(topicId);
            if (accessControlService.canViewTopics(t.getCategory())) {
                return t;
            } else {
                throw new AccessDeniedException(Action.VIEW, getCurrentUserId(), topicId, PermissionType.TOPIC);
            }
        }
    ```
  - checks if user has sufficient permissions for viewing certain ui components(for example deleting a topic)
    ```
    private Link createRemoveLink(final IModel<Topic> tm) {
    ...
       @Override
       protected void onConfigure() {
          super.onConfigure();
          setVisible(accessControlService.canRemoveTopic(tm.getObject()));
       }
    }
    ```
    
- __AccessControlManagerService__ contains methods for checking another user's permissions.
  - example usage in application 
    ```
    accessControlManagerService.canRemoveDiscussion(userService.getUserById(5), discussionService.getDiscussionById(2))
    ```
    - will check if __user__ of id __5__ has permissions to remove __discussion__ of id __2__.

The services need an interface to access the database, which is located in the dao package. The default implementation of services is in the __dao.imp__ package.

## Readme: discussment-ui-wicket 
The library creates UI for the discussion. The discussion may be under the article or as a separate forum.

### dependencies
The library uses a __discussion-core__ and the wicket library to create UI. The bootstrap library is used for styling html.

Used dependencies:

- discussment-core 1.0-SNAPSHOT

- Wicket Core 7.6.0

### build steps
- Before the translation, the __discussion-core__ library must be stored in the local maven repository.

- In the __discussion-ui-wicket__ folder where the __pom.xml__ file is located, run command `mvn install`.

- The resulting __jar__ file is stored in a local maven repository.

### how-to use ui-wicket
The library contains these packages:

- __form__ contains forms such as adding a new category to the forum.

- __list__ contains panels that create parts of the user interface. The panels use other the panels to create a larger unit. For example, CategoryListPanel, which displays categories and topics, uses TopicListPanel to display topics.

- __model__ contains classes for data acquisition. Classes can be used as a parameter for creating a ListView instance.

- __panel__ contains the __DiscussionPanel__ and __ForumPanel__ classes that are ready to be used in a application.

__DiscussionPanel__ creates a panel which contains a discussion. This panel can be used below a article like a discussion about the article. The panel contains an input field for adding a new post and listing all posts and their replies.

__ForumPanel__ creates a panel that contains a forum. The forum is ready for use on a separate page. The panel manages category and topics with discussions. The user can create categories and topics according to their own needs, where forum users can create discussions.
